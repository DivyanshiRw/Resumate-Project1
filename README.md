## üìÑ Key Module: `resumate_scorer.py`

This file implements the core analysis for evaluating resume quality. Key functions include:

- **`clean_text`**: Normalizes text by removing unwanted characters, lowercasing, and filtering out stopwords (with exceptions for meaningful modifiers).
- **`check_resume_sections`**: Verifies if core sections like *skills, experience, education,* and *projects* are present and adds bonus points for additional sections like *certifications* and *awards*.
- **`check_contact_info`**: Searches for email and LinkedIn details, providing a high score if both are present.
- **`check_metrics`**: Identifies quantifiable achievements (e.g., percentages, monetary figures) and assigns up to 100 points.
- **`check_grammar`**: Leverages the LanguageTool Public API to detect grammatical and spelling errors and applies a penalty accordingly.
- **`check_length`**: Ensures the resume falls within an ideal word count (300‚Äì950 words).
- **`jd_match_score`**: Computes similarity between the resume and a job description using TF-IDF and cosine similarity.
- **`compute_resume_score`**: Aggregates the above evaluations with weighted scores and provides an overall score, quality label, detailed breakdown, and improvement suggestions.
